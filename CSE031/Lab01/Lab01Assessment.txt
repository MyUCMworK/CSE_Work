01. What does the –c flag do in gcc?
    -c flage compiles the source file to an assembly language file, and it compiles the source file without linking
02. What does the –o flag do in gcc?
    -o flage compiles the source file to an executable file
03. How do you load output0 into gdb? (give the command)
    compile output0.c first, and lldb ./output0
    gcc output0.c -o output0
    lldb ./output0
04. How do you set breakpoint at main? (give the command)
    b main
05. Command to run output0 inside gdb
    run
06. Command to single-step through the program
    step
07. First output gives the value of the most significant bit (MSB) of an unsigned int. What is the size (# of bits) of an unsigned int?
    16 bits or 32 bits
08. Second output gives the value of a long long int. What is the size of a long long?
    64 bits
09. Third output shows the most negative signed int. Is the size of a signed int the same as an unsigned int?
    Yes, they are both 16 bits or 32 bits
10. Fourth line shows the value of the most negative valueʼs negation, ie – most_negative_number. 
    What is the output and the reason for the value to be this way? (Hint: remember the property of 2ʼs complement representation)
    2's complement number lines have one more negative number compare to positive number. Therefore, the most negative number does not have a corresponding positive number.
